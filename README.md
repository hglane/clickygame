# Welcome to the MLB React Clicky Game! 

On the default page, you will see 12 squares- all representing a different Major League Baseball Team. 

Your objective: click on as many squares as you can without repeating a team. 

Each time you select a square, the order of the teams will change. If you can click all squares without repeating a team, you have beaten the game! 

Let's see how good that memory really is! 

Good luck
